 IB-516-project

Repository includes analysis of two complexes of Rockfish found off of the Oregon Coast. The OYTB complex can be ID'ed using physical characteristics under a microscope, while the QGBCC complex requires genetic analysis to aquire an ID. This Repository includes the workflow, files, and scripts needed to determine species specific settlement rates and create plots that allign with legacy settlement plots created by previous graduate students.  

Subdirectories:  
raw_data: includes scripts needed to download files from the University of Oregon sequencing center for the QGBCC analysis as well as the wt.txt data download file and the props_sfla file used to determine OYTB species specific settlement rates. 

data_prep: includes scripts and references files needed for the alignment analysis and species ID of the QGBCC samples. It also includes the legacy_recruitment_table.R script that creates recruitment rates for complexes of rockfish. This file is used in the OYTB_recruitment_CR.R script to create a species specific settlement rate table. 

analysis: contains scripts needed to make legacy settlement plots, species specific settlement plots, and plots generated for the 2021 ODFW Synthesis Report. 

final_figs: includes final figures created by the analysis of settlement rates for nearshore Rockfish.
